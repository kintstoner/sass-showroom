## Welcome to advanded SASS showroom!

This project is an angular wrapper, made for the [Advanced css and sass course] of Udemy site, which is created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the power of Sass features and how to use them in real-world projects. Sass is a powerful css preprocessor, which is used to make css more maintainable, reusable, and organized.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.
